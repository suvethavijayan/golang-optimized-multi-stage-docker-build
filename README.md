# Multi Stage Docker Build

The main reason for choosing a Go-based application is that Go is a statically-compiled language that doesn't require a runtime environment like dynamically-interpreted languages such as Python or JavaScript. Go compiles directly to machine code, making it ideal for multi-stage Docker builds and distroless images. This approach significantly reduces the final image size, enhances security, and removes unnecessary dependencies, making the container more efficient and secure.
